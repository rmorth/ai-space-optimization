# Problem

Given a dataset that includes a set of pieces with various shapes and the surface's height, the goal is to optimise the placement of the pieces on the surface of raw material (supposedly for cutting) in order to save as much material as possible.

## Solution

Implementation of a genetic algorithm, the main characteristics that are evaluated:

- Material waste when placing pieces
- Number of cuts needed for the pieces

## Context

This project was made in the scope of an Artificial Intelligence course unit. Along with this, I also wrote a report detailing the implementation process as well as the experimentation process, which is not available in the repository.

There will be no more work done on this project as it's concluded, although there are lots of potential improvements that can be made.
